# Movie Recommendation System
## Overview

This project is a movie recommendation system designed to suggest movies based on a user's previous search history and interests. The system leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Features

- *Collaborative Filtering*: Recommends movies by finding users with similar tastes and suggesting movies they have liked.
- *Content-Based Filtering*: Suggests movies similar to those the user has previously enjoyed, based on movie attributes like genre, cast, and keywords.
- *Hybrid Approach*: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy and address the cold-start problem.

## Libraries and Tools

- *Python*: The primary programming language used for the project.
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation and analysis.
- *NumPy*: For numerical operations.
- *Scikit-learn*: For machine learning algorithms.
- *Surprise*: For building and evaluating collaborative filtering models.
- *NLTK*: For natural language processing tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movierecommender.git
   cd movierecommender
   

2. Install the required libraries:
   bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scikit-surprise nltk
   

## Usage

1. *Data Preparation*: Load and preprocess the movie and ratings datasets.
   python
   import pandas as pd
   from surprise import Dataset

   # Load datasets
   movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
   ratings = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')

   # Merge datasets
   data = Dataset.load_builtin('ml-100k')
   

2. *Model Training*: Train the recommendation models using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
   python
   from surprise import SVD
   from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split

   # Split data into training and testing sets
   trainset, testset = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.25)

   # Train the SVD model
   algo = SVD()
   algo.fit(trainset)
   

3. *Making Recommendations*: Generate movie recommendations for a user.
   python
   from surprise import accuracy

   # Make predictions
   predictions = algo.test(testset)

   # Evaluate the model
   accuracy.rmse(predictions)
